# Text to Video Generator

## Introduction

The Text to Video Generator is a state-of-the-art model developed by ModelScope for generating videos from textual descriptions. This model is based on a multi-stage text-to-video generation diffusion model and is capable of taking English text as input and returning videos that match the text description.

- Model Name: text-to-video-ms-1.7b
- Developed by: ModelScope
- Model Type: Diffusion-based text-to-video generation model
- Total Parameters: Approximately 1.7 billion

## Model Description

The Text to Video Generator model consists of three key components:

1. **Text Feature Extraction Model:** This part of the model extracts features from the input textual description.
2. **Text Feature-to-Video Latent Space Diffusion Model:** It transforms the text features into video latent space.
3. **Video Latent Space to Video Visual Space Model:** The model generates the final video output from the video latent space through an iterative denoising process.

The model uses a UNet3D structure and implements video generation from pure Gaussian noise.

## Usage

To use the Text to Video Generator, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for details.

2. Load the model using your preferred deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).

3. Input your text description in English.

4. Generate a video that corresponds to the input text.

## Model Limitations and Biases

- The model is trained on publicly available datasets, such as Webvid, and may produce results with deviations related to the distribution of the training data.

- It cannot achieve perfect film and television-quality video generation.

- The model is not designed to generate clear text; it focuses on text-to-video synthesis.

- Primarily trained with English corpus, the model currently does not support other languages.

- While capable of impressive results, the performance of this model may require improvement for complex compositional generation tasks.
